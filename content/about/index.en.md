### About author

<img style="float: right;" src="/images/avatar.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">

Since the early childhood I have been fond of computers. As a teenager, I played World of Warcraft very actively. When I got tired of the games, I realized that I had too many psychological problems. Therefore, without hesitation, I went to study psychology in the hope of settling internal conflicts. By the 4th year, I became disillusioned with this education and decided to devote my life to what I liked since childhood.

That's how I got into IT.

I am one of those people who can quickly make a decision in a critical situation, who will solve a non-urgent problem until the result suits me and those around me. I am very inspired by people who have fire in their eyes, who do as they see fit, while convincing others that they are right. I also understand perfectly well that behind any “success stories” (in this case I mean recognized professionals in their field) in life there are months and years of sometimes monotonous, sometimes unforeseen work, crunch, liters of coffee and tons of nerves.

  - Added new features (like calculating maintenance time based on clickhouse sent/received
    message data per client/WA sender number) to internal tool that helps managing whatsapp
    business app instances across k8s clusters.
  - Started driving an epic about internal WA sender manager UI/UX improvements to make in
    more intuitive and easy-to-use. I want people to spend less time on searching features they
    need. And also i want to make it look more stylish.
  - Wrote automation scripts that help deploy/upgrade/migrate WA sender instances between
    locations (internal<>cloud).
  - Successfully finished migration of WA sender instances from VMs to k8s.
  - Was moving stuff from bash scripts that are used in jenkins job to WA sender management tool. 
    I believe that everything related to product must be in one place and should be changed
    only once if needed.
  - I was interacting with other teams and helped them in solving issues that happen on WA
    sender instance and helped to escalate issues to facebook whatsapp team.

- System Engineer,
  **Reksoft • Saint Petersburg**
  _05/2019 - 08/2020_
  - I deployed a k8s cluster on hardware. Raised on it rook (rook.io), nexus, teamcity, stolon
    postgres. The cluster is used for local (within the company) testing of java microservices. Now
    we are working on the issue of raising the tunnel to the customer's infrastructure, in which
    gerrit and test infrastructure for the current project are running. As a result, the project ended
    faster than the issue was resolved.
  - Communication with contractors. Solving problems arising in the process of joint
    exploitation in the work of microservices.
  - Migrating test environments between k8s clusters
  - Recently, frequent consultations of the customer on infrastructure issues. Consulting the
    customer's contractors when moving from Jenkins to Gitlab CI.
  > Among the latest significant achievements is the deployment of the
    infrastructure for the project (k8s, postgres, prometheus operator, jaeger, metallb) on the
    customer's side in a week from scratch. The cluster was deployed under my strict guidance by the customer
    representatives using kubespray.
